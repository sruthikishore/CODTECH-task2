PREDICTIVE MODELING WITH LINEAR REGRESSION

Overview
Predictive modeling with linear regression involves using statistical techniques to predict a continuous outcome variable (dependent variable) based on one or more predictor variables (independent variables). Linear regression models the relationship between these variables by fitting a linear equation to observed data.

Key Steps
Data Preparation
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Model Building
Model Training
Model Evaluation
Model Tuning
